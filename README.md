## Key Features

- Very simple application, where users can order one **or more pizzas from a menu**
- **Requires no user accounts** and no login: users just input their names before using the app
- The pizza menu can change, so it should be **loaded from an API**
- Users can add multiple pizzas to a **cart** before ordering
- Ordering requires just the **user's name, phone number**, and **address**
- If possible, **GPS location** should also be provided, to make delivery easier
- User's can **mark their order as "priority"** for an additional 20% of the cart price
- Orders are made by **sending a POST request** with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the API
- Payments are made on delivery, so **no payment processing** is necessary in the app
- Each order will get a **unique ID** that should be displayed, so the **user can later look up their order** based on the ID
- Users should be able to mark their order as "priority" order **even after it has been placed**

## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) - A simplified, efficient, and powerful Redux library for building state management systems
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - Utility-first CSS framework for building any design
- HTML5
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A JavaScript module bundler and development server.

## What I Learned

During the course of this project, I had the opportunity to learn and improve my Tailwind CSS skills. I also gained a deeper understanding of React router with thunk, and I learned how to use React Redux Toolkit to manage state in my React applications. These new skills have made me a better developer, and I am excited to use them in future projects.
